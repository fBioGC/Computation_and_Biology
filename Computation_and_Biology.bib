  abstract = {It is easy for today's students and researchers to believe that modern bioinformatics emerged recently to assist next-generation sequencing data analysis. However, the very beginnings of bioinformatics occurred more than 50 years ago, when desktop computers were still a hypothesis and DNA could not yet be sequenced. The foundations of bioinformatics were laid in the early 1960s with the application of computational methods to protein sequence analysis (notably, de novo sequence assembly, biological sequence databases and substitution models). Later on, DNA analysis also emerged due to parallel advances in (i) molecular biology methods, which allowed easier manipulation of DNA, as well as its sequencing, and (ii) computer science, which saw the rise of increasingly miniaturized and more powerful computers, as well as novel software better suited to handle bioinformatics tasks. In the 1990s through the 2000s, major improvements in sequencing technology, along with reduced costs, gave rise to an exponential increase of data. The arrival of 'Big Data' has laid out new challenges in terms of data mining and management, calling for more expertise from computer science into the field. Coupled with an ever-increasing amount of bioinformatics tools, biological Big Data had (and continues to have) profound implications on the predictive power and reproducibility of bioinformatics results. To overcome this issue, universities are now fully integrating this discipline into the curriculum of biology students. Recent subdisciplines such as synthetic biology, systems biology and whole-cell modeling have emerged from the ever-increasing complementarity between computer science and biology.},

abstract = {Among the main chemical constituents of the human body--and, in fact, of all living things--are proteins. In addition to serving as component structural parts of many types of living tissues, the proteins are enzymes that are necessary in order that the chemical reactions which comprise the life processes may occur. The protein enzymes act to "decode" the message of the genes, interpreting this message in terms of specific chemical reactions which determine the physical and functional characteristics of the organism. Thus proteins play a uniquely vital role in the evolution, ontogeny, and maintenance of living organisms. It therefore becomes important when studying the basis of life processes to know the structure of the proteins themselves.},

	abstract = {Five extraordinary papers by Albert Einstein that transformed physics , edited and introduced by John Stachel and with a foreword by Nobel laureate Roger Penrose After 1905 , Einstein's miraculous year , physics would never be the same again. In those twelve months , Einstein shattered many cherished scientific beliefs with five extraordinary papers that would establish him as the world's leading physicist. This book brings those papers together in an accessible format. The best-known papers are the two that founded special relativity: On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies and Does the Inertia of a Body Depend on Its Energy Content? In the former , Einstein showed that absolute time had to be replaced by a new absolute: the speed of light. In the second , he asserted the equivalence of mass and energy , which would lead to the famous formula E = mc2.The book also includes On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light , in which Einstein challenged the wave theory of light , suggesting that light could also be regarded as a collection of particles. This helped to open the door to a whole new world\textemdash that of quantum physics. For ideas in this paper , he won the Nobel Prize in 1921.The fourth paper also led to a Nobel Prize , although for another scientist , Jean Perrin. On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in Stationary Liquids Required by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat concerns the Brownian motion of such particles. With profound insight , Einstein blended ideas from kinetic theory and classical hydrodynamics to derive an equation for the mean free path of such particles as a function of the time , which Perrin confirmed experimentally. The fifth paper , A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions , was Einstein's doctoral dissertation , and remains among his most cited articles. It shows how to calculate Avogadro's number and the size of molecules.These papers , presented in a modern English translation , are essential reading for any physicist , mathematician , or astrophysicist. Far more than just a collection of scientific articles , this book presents work that is among the high points of human achievement and marks a watershed in the history of science.Coinciding with the 100th anniversary of the miraculous year , this new paperback edition includes an introduction by John Stachel , which focuses on the personal aspects of Einstein's youth that facilitated and led up to the miraculous year.}

In science , philosophy , and theology , this is a book that changed the world.

Methods for the isolation and purification of the active transforming material are described. 3. The data obtained by chemical , enzymatic , and serological analyses together with the results of preliminary studies by electrophoresis , ultracentrifugation , and ultraviolet spectroscopy indicate that , within the limits of the methods , the active fraction contains no demonstrable protein , unbound lipid , or serologically reactive polysaccharide and consists principally , if not solely , of a highly polymerized , viscous form of desoxyribonucleic acid. 4. Evidence is presented that the chemically induced alterations in cellular structure and function are predictable , type-specific , and transmissible in series.

	abstract = {1. Osmotic shock disrupts particles of phage T2 into material containing nearly all the phage sulfur in a form precipitable by antiphage serum , and capable of specific adsorption to bacteria. It releases into solution nearly all the phage DNA in a form not precipitable by antiserum and not adsorbable to bacteria. The sulfur-containing protein of the phage particle evidently makes up a membrane that protects the phage DNA from DNase , comprises the sole or principal antigenic material , and is responsible for attachment of the virus to bacteria. 2. Adsorption of T2 to heat-killed bacteria , and heating or alternate freezing and thawing of infected cells , sensitize the DNA of the adsorbed phage to DNase. These treatments have little or no sensitizing effect on unadsorbed phage. Neither heating nor freezing and thawing releases the phage DNA from infected cells , although other cell constituents can be extracted by these methods. These facts suggest that the phage DNA forms part of an organized intracellular structure throughout the period of phage growth. 3. Adsorption of phage T2 to bacterial debris causes part of the phage DNA to appear in solution , leaving the phage sulfur attached to the debris. Another part of the phage DNA , corresponding roughly to the remaining half of the DNA of the inactivated phage , remains attached to the debris but can be separated from it by DNase. Phage T4 behaves similarly , although the two phages can be shown to attach to different combining sites. The inactivation of phage by bacterial debris is evidently accompanied by the rupture of the viral membrane. 4. Suspensions of infected cells agitated in a Waring blendor release 75 per cent of the phage sulfur and only 15 per cent of the phage phosphorus to the solution as a result of the applied shearing force. The cells remain capable of yielding phage progeny. 5. The facts stated show that most of the phage sulfur remains at the cell surface and most of the phage DNA enters the cell on infection. Whether sulfur-free material other than DNA enters the cell has not been determined. The properties of the sulfur-containing residue identify it as essentially unchanged membranes of the phage particles. All types of evidence show that the passage of phage DNA into the cell occurs in non-nutrient medium under conditions in which other known steps in viral growth do not occur. 6. The phage progeny yielded by bacteria infected with phage labeled with radioactive sulfur contain less than 1 per cent of the parental radioactivity. The progeny of phage particles labeled with radioactive phosphorus contain 30 per cent or more of the parental phosphorus. 7. Phage inactivated by dilute formaldehyde is capable of adsorbing to bacteria , but does not release its DNA to the cell. This shows that the interaction between phage and bacterium resulting in release of the phage DNA from its protective membrane depends on labile components of the phage particle. By contrast , the components of the bacterium essential to this interaction are remarkably stable. The nature of the interaction is otherwise unknown. 8. The sulfur-containing protein of resting phage particles is confined to a protective coat that is responsible for the adsorption to bacteria , and functions as an instrument for the injection of the phage DNA into the cell. This protein probably has no function in the growth of intracellular phage. The DNA has some function. Further chemical inferences should not be drawn from the experiments presented.},

	abstract = {The sequence of the human genome encodes the genetic instructions for human physiology , as well as rich information about human evolution. In 2001 , the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then , the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here , we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers { $\sim$ } 99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of { $\sim$ } 1 event per 100 , 000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence , the first for a vertebrate , greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number , birth and death. Notably , the human genome seems to encode only 20 , 000\textendash 25 , 000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.}

The future progress in understanding biological principles will increasingly depend on the development of temporal and spatial analytical techniques that will provide high-resolution data for systems analyses. To date , particularly successful were strategies involving (a) quantitative measurements of cellular components at the mRNA , protein and metabolite levels , as well as in vivo metabolic reaction rates , (b) development of mathematical models that integrate biochemical knowledge with the information generated by high-throughput experiments , and (c) applications to microbial organisms. The inevitable role bioinformatics plays in modern systems biology puts mathematical and computational sciences as an equal partner to analytical and experimental biology. Furthermore , mathematical and computational models are expected to become increasingly prevalent representations of our knowledge about specific biochemical systems.}

Yet , the challenge for biology overall is to understand how organisms function. By discovering how function arises in dynamic interactions , systems biology addresses the missing links between molecules and physiology. Top-down systems biology identifies molecular interaction networks on the basis of correlated molecular behavior observed in genome-wide 'omics' studies. Bottom-up systems biology examines the mechanisms through which functional properties arise in the interactions of known components. Here , we outline the challenges faced by systems biology and discuss limitations of the top-down and bottom-up approaches , which , despite these limitations , have already led to the discovery of mechanisms and principles that underlie cell function. \textcopyright { } 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These metabolic networks can be modelled and analysed (computed) to study complex biological functions7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11. In particular , constraints-based in silico models12 have been used to calculate optimal growth rates on common carbon substrates , and the results were found to be consistent with experimental data under many but not all conditions13 , 14. Optimal biological functions are acquired through an evolutionary process. Thus , incorrect predictions of in silico models based on optimal performance criteria may be due to incomplete adaptive evolution under the conditions examined. Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 grows sub-optimally on glycerol as the sole carbon source. Here we show that when placed under growth selection pressure , the growth rate of E. coli on glycerol reproducibly evolved over 40 days , or about 700 generations , from a sub-optimal value to the optimal growth rate predicted from a whole-cell in silico model. These results open the possibility of using adaptive evolution of entire metabolic networks to realize metabolic states that have been determined a priori based on in silico analysis.}

Image processing techniques are allowing earlier detection of abnormalities and treatment monitoring.

	abstract = {Variation in avian diversity in space and time is commonly used as a metric to assess environmental changes. Conventionally , such data were collected by expert observers , but passively collected acoustic data is rapidly emerging as an alternative survey technique. However , efficiently extracting accurate species richness data from large audio datasets has proven challenging. Recent advances in deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of machine learning , frequently outperforming traditional signal processing techniques in the domain of acoustic event detection and classification. We developed a DNN , called BirdNET , capable of identifying 984 North American and European bird species by sound. Our task-specific model architecture was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets) , consisted of 157 layers with more than 27 million parameters , and was trained using extensive data pre-processing , augmentation , and mixup. We tested the model against three independent datasets: (a) 22 , 960 single-species recordings; (b) 286~h of fully annotated soundscape data collected by an array of autonomous recording units in a design analogous to what researchers might use to measure avian diversity in a field setting; and (c) 33 , 670~h of soundscape data from a single high-quality omnidirectional microphone deployed near four eBird hotspots frequented by expert birders. We found that domain-specific data augmentation is key to build models that are robust against high ambient noise levels and can cope with overlapping vocalizations. Task-specific model designs and training regimes for audio event recognition perform on-par with very complex architectures used in other domains (e.g. , object detection in images). We also found that high temporal resolution of input spectrograms (short FFT window length) improves the classification performance for bird sounds. In summary , BirdNET achieved a mean average precision of 0.791 for single-species recordings , a F0.5 score of 0.414 for annotated soundscapes , and an average correlation of 0.251 with hotspot observation across 121 species and 4~years of audio data. By enabling the efficient extraction of the vocalizations of many hundreds of bird species from potentially vast amounts of audio data , BirdNET and similar tools have the potential to add tremendous value to existing and future passively collected audio datasets and may transform the field of avian ecology and conservation.}
